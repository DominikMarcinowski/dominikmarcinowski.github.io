I'm soooo happy to start this new journey of mine. I wanted to have a place where I can share things I find intresting, rant about stuff that annoyes me, in general place to write what gose in my mind.

I am by no means a writer, or story teller, so please don't expect exceptional writing skills.
I'm just a programmer, leave me alone ;). Also I'm dyslectic so I can sometimes make spelling mistakes...

## Who even am I...

Hi, I'm Dominik, I'm {{<age>}} years old self-thought programmer ([more&nbsp;about&nbsp;me here](/about)). I like computers, programming, manga and anime, and also I enjoy listening to good music.

## This website

This website was created using {{<ablank "https://gohugo.io/" "Hugo">}}, heavly inspired by {{<ablank "https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/" "hello-friend-ng">}} theme (but rewritten from ground up) with **Atom one** color palette.

I recently stumbled upon the {{<ablank "https://unlicense.org/" "unlicense">}} and I really like the idea. So if you like what you see and you wanna *StEaL* this website's {{<ablank "https://github.com/dominikmarcinowski/dominikmarcinowski.github.io" "source code">}}, just go agead, I don't mind.
