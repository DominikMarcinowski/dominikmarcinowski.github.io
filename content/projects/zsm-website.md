ZSM stands for Zespół Szkół Mechanicznych (rough tl: Mechanical School Complex).
It's a technical high-school in which I've got my IT mechanic degree.

This project was part of apprenticeships. I was part of frontend developement team, mainly in part of design.
Also I was in charge in makeing this website responsive.
